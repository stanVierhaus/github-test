The readme.md file is meant to be a readme file using the Markdown format syntax and will take precedence over the README file to show on Github.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
